For this recitation you will only need to work in the script.js file. This being said you will need to look at the basicPoll.py file for POST and GET functions.

This file has four TODOs (I suggest doing them in order). There are hints included with some of the TODOs and specific language in the bullet points that will help with searching the internet if an issue arises. Also, please feel free to look at Dr. Farnan's examples since my code is heavily based on his.

You will notice that there is no model.py file. All data stored is in a dictionary on the server, and therefore is ephemeral (when exiting basicPoll.py the data will be lost).

To run: python basicPoll.py
- Then you can go to your appropriate local host in a browser

Important! javascript static files tend to be cached. Therefore a refresh may not reflect changes in your js file. Therefore, you should do a hard refresh (e.g. on mac using Google Chrome CMD+Shift+R). Another way to get around this is to clear your cache.
